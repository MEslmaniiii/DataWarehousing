Datasets I stitched together from real-world datasources. CRM + core banking. Built off of that 1999 czech data
core banking system. accounts linked by identifiers. FULLY TRANSLATED and further modified and augmented data built off the real 1999 Czech banking dataset posted to my profile.

-----geospatial data is only accurate at a zip code and area code of phone number level for MA and NY records

-----addresses are not real, but MA and NY zip codes are, other zip codes are random numbers from 40000-60000 I think

CRM Datasets - Frankenstein data. try parsing the text in the CRM events for sentiment analysis. These were built off of financial institution complaints database so everyone is most likely very upset.

-----some phone calls from call center match to CRM event records

-----some phone calls from call center are from known client numbers so we can infer who called!

-----some phone calls for certain clients are from alternative phone numbers so we can figure out a back up phone number for them!

Luxury Loan Portfolio

-----Eagle National just acquired this loan portfolio.

-----how are interest rates for loans determined (hint I generated them off of 3 factors.....one is size of loan...)

-----can you combine all loan data for the bank and forecast profits or collections for a few years out??
